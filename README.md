# Welcome to the PHP MVC Framework
## DEVELOPED BY GEORGI ANGELOV

## Introduction
    This PHP MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework provides a structured and efficient way to develop web applications using PHP. The MVC architecture separates the application logic into three interconnected components: Models, Views, and Controllers. This separation of concerns improves code organization, maintainability, and scalability.
    Features
