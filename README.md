# Steps to install Composer in the AdvertisingBidAuction directory:

# Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the AdvertisingBidAuction directory:
cd /var/www/html/task/AdvertisingBidAuction

# Execute the following command to download and install Composer in the current directory:
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

# This will create a composer.phar file in the AdvertisingBidAuction directory.

# Once Composer is installed, you can use Composer commands to add dependencies to your project or generate autoload files and others. For example, to install dependencies from the composer.json file, you can use the following command:
php composer.phar install

# This will install all dependencies defined in your composer.json file. If you don't have a composer.json file, you can create one and add your class autoload configuration as well as other settings you want to have for your project.
